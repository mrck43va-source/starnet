/* node test/ctx-model-catalog.test.js — regression guard for the CONTEXT-GAUGE CATALOG WIPE (fix 1fa14b35).

   THE DEFECT. Harness kept ONE shared `modelMap` for every provider. ModelDock warms ~17 providers in
   parallel (modeldock.js fetchModels) and every listModels(p) reset that one map, so whichever provider
   resolved LAST — usually an unconfigured one handing back an EMPTY list — wiped the ACTIVE provider's
   catalog. contextLimitOf()/priceOf() then returned 0 for the live model, CtxGauge computed known:false,
   and the bottom-bar CTX gauge sat at '—' with ten hollow cells forever. The occupancy reading itself was
   correct the whole time (a real turn measured 10903 prompt tokens against limit 0), which is exactly why
   this survived: nothing looked broken except the one number a user reads.

   WHY THIS IS BEHAVIOURAL AND NOT A SOURCE LOCK. The bug is a write-ordering race between two providers,
   so a grep for `modelsByProv` would pass on any code that merely names it. This test runs the REAL
   listModels / contextLimitOf / priceOf / catalogModel bodies sliced out of harness.js in a vm sandbox
   (the idiom from dossier-reliability.test.js / agent-config-target.test.js — harness.js is browser-flow
   and not node-loadable as a whole) and replays the actual 17-provider warm. The slice is anchored on
   names that exist in BOTH the fixed and the pre-fix source, so reverting the fix makes this fail on a
   VALUE (0 instead of 200000) rather than on a missing symbol. Verified: red against 1fa14b35^1. */
