/* node test/rec-evidence.test.js — W2 of the recommendation perfection campaign: EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE.

   The audit's SECOND root cause: `internal:true` starves the generators. An internal run keeps the caller's
   prompt verbatim — right for a strict-format parse, and wrong for the three components that must GUESS what
   the Commander wants next. The First Pitch, the goal decomposition and the ongoing suggestion were reasoning
   from strictly LESS about the Commander than an ordinary task run receives: no learned topics with their
   verbatim quotes, no open threads, no verdict patterns, no recent activity, no active goal.

   This suite holds the two halves of the fix:

     1. THE EVIDENCE PACK REACHES THEM — `evidence:true` rides the browser call, the route, and runOnce, and
        appends the SAME bounded, provenance-labelled pack (commander-context.js) an ordinary task gets. And
        NOTHING ELSE about the internal path changes: no manual, no capability summary, no skills.
     2. THE SUGGEST EVIDENCE CONTRACT — the model must produce the Commander's OWN words, that quote is VETOED
        against what the station actually knows (fail-closed), only a survivor is spoken as «because you said»,
        and the ledger row finally distinguishes a real quote from the model's own rationale.

   Plus the Q3 staleness guard the earlier plan named but never wired: a pitch is never silently aimed at a
   belief the station itself would not assert. */
